FAIR
    FAIR data is data which meets the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data).

UI
    Graphical user interface, for instance, a browser-based data catalog.

feature
    A feature is a property of a measurement [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning))]. It's equivalent to a {term}`variable` in statistics and is typically equated with a dimension of a dataset.

    LaminDB comes with a {class}`~lamindb.Feature` registry to organize dataset dimensions and equates them with statistical variables.

label
    A label refers to a descriptor or tag that is assigned to something to describe, identify, or categorize it.

lakehouse
    A data lakehouse combines the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of a data lake with the data management and ACID transaction support of a data warehouse, enabling both structured and unstructured data analytics in a single framework. Lakehouse frameworks include Databrick's [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/), Google's [BigLake](https://cloud.google.com/biglake), Amazon's [Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/), [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/), [Starburst](https://www.starburst.io/) and others. Here is a [blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/unify-data-lakes-and-warehouses-with-biglake-now-generally-available) from Google, a [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/build-a-lake-house-architecture-on-aws/) from AWS, a [glossary entry](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse) and a [paper](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf) from Databricks.

ORM
    Object-relational mapper. In LaminDB every sub-class of `Record` (every instance of `Registry`) is an ORM that corresponds to a SQL table in the underlying metadata database [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping).

observation
    In statistics (machine learning), an observation refers to a particular measured instance of a set of random variable.

    In biology, an observation typically corresponds to measuring (reading out) a set of properties from a biological sample.

record
    A record is a data structure that consists in a sequence of typed [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science)) that hold values [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science))].

    In LaminDB, a metadata record is modeled as a {class}`~lamindb.models.Record`.

sample
    In biology, a sample is an instance or part of a biological system.

    In statistics (machine learning), a sample is an observation of a set of random variables (features, labels, metadata).

    Depending on the observational unit chosen for representing data, the statistical sample might correspond 1:1 to a biological sample.
    Often, this choice presents an interesting cases, as variation across physical samples - targeted in the experimental design - can directly be explained by variation across statistical (digital) samples.

variable
    We almost always mean "random variable", when we say "variable".

    Random variables and their observations are core to statistics [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable)].

    An independent variable is sometimes called a {term}`feature`, "predictor variable", "regressor", "covariate", "explanatory variable", "risk factor", "input variable", among others [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables)].

    A dependent variable is sometimes called a "response variable", "regressand", "criterion", "predicted variable", "measured variable", "explained variable", "experimental variable", "responding variable", "outcome variable", "output variable", "target" or "label".

schema
    Blueprint for your dataâ€™s structure. Tool for curating and validating the organization of your data, helping maintain data integrity as it evolves through various processing steps.

curator
    - Object class designed to ensure your dataset conforms to a desired schema. 
    - Helps with validation, standardization (e.g., by fixing typos or mapping synonyms), and annotation (linking it against metadata entities so that it becomes queryable).

registry
    - A specialized kind of Record that represents a table in the metadata SQL database. A record is an instance (or row) of that registry.
    - It automatically sets up important behaviors and methods (like filtering, querying, and converting records to DataFrames) needed to interact with the metadata database.

instance
    A database that manages metadata for datasets in different storage locations.

transform
    A piece of code (script, notebook, pipeline, function) that can be applied to input data to produce output data.

artifact
    Stores a dataset or model as a file or folder.
