# Pipelines

Workflow managers (Nextflow, Snakemake, redun, etc.) schedule, execute, and track pipeline runs with a great level of control and metadata.

LaminDB tracks data lineage on a higher level (_across_ pipelines, notebooks & app uploads) and models data using biological entities.

The following use cases demonstrate how to integrate LaminDB with workflow managers.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

../redun
../nextflow
```
