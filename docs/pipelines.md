# Integrate workflow managers

Workflow managers (Nextflow, Snakemake, redun, etc.) schedule, execute, and track pipeline runs with a great level of control & metadata.

LaminDB integrates with and complements such tools by

1. tracking data lineage on a higher level (_across_ pipelines, notebooks & app uploads)
2. modeling data using biological entities

The following use cases demonstrate how to integrate LaminDB with workflow managers.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

redun
nextflow
snakemake
```
