LaminHub provides a layer for AWS & GCP that makes access management more secure & intuitive.

Rather than configuring storage & database permissions directly on AWS or GCP, LaminHub allows you to manage collaborators for databases & storages as intuitively as you manage access to git repositories on GitHub.

In contrast to a closed SaaS product like GitHub, LaminHub leaves you in full control of your data with direct API access to storage & databases at your cloud provider.

How does it work? Based on an identity provider (Google, GitHub, SSO, OIDC) and a role-based permission system, LaminDB users automatically receive federated access tokens for resources on AWS or GCP.
