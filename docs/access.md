# Access management

## LaminDB

LaminDB doesn't come with access management but relies on the underlying data infrastructure for this.

## LaminHub

```{include} includes/access-laminhub.md

```

## Cloud providers

Currently, only on the enterprise plan, we're happy to

1. host databases & storage in Lamin's AWS/GCP infrastructure
2. help you connect LaminHub to databases & storage in your AWS/GCP infrastructure

We'll role out a fully hosted Pro plan over time.
