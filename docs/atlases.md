# Atlases

Atlases provide centralized access data with standardized metadata.

LaminDB can be used as a query engine for atlases:

1. Unify storage and metadta with the same API
2. Easy access to registered metadata with autocompletion

The following use cases demonstrate how to integrate LaminDB with atlases:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

census
```
