LaminHub is a data collaboration hub built on LaminDB, similar to how GitHub is built on git.

It offers free access to large omics data collections at [lamin.ai/explore](https://lamin.ai/explore) and provides a GUI for LaminDB's lakehouse, lineage, feature store, ontologies, LIMS, and ELN capabilities.

LaminHub also makes it easy to manage many LaminDB instances including hosting, access management & audit logs.

Through the open-source LaminDB, developers retain full access to their data with zero lock-in danger. Instead of depending on rate-limited REST APIs, developers build directly with Postgres & diverse open storage formats on object stores. This is possible because LaminHub connects databases and storage locations in the data centers where developers run their compute.

Most functionality is available for AWS data centers, with support for other cloud providers and fully on-prem solutions also possible.

LaminHub is a SaaS product. For private data & commercial usage, see: [lamin.ai/pricing](https://lamin.ai/pricing).
