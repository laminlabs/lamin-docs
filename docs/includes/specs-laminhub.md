Explore a GUI for working with LaminDB instances that publicly hosts several large omics data collections for free: [lamin.ai/explore](https://lamin.ai/explore).

While you stay in full control over storage & database permissions directly on AWS or GCP, LaminHub allows you to manage access similar to how you'd do it on GitHub, Google Drive, Microsoft Sharepoint, or Notion. See {doc}`access`.

LaminHub is a SaaS product. For private & commercial usage, see: [lamin.ai/pricing](https://lamin.ai/pricing).
