LaminHub is a data collaboration hub built on LaminDB, similar to how GitHub is built on git.

It offers free access to large omics data collections at [lamin.ai/explore](https://lamin.ai/explore) and provides a GUI LaminDB's lakehouse, lineage, feature store, ontologies, LIMS, and ELN capabilities.

LaminHub also makes it easy to manage many LaminDB instances including hosting, access management & audit logs.

Developers retain full access to their data at zero lock-in danger through the open-source LaminDB. Instead of depending on a rate-limited REST, developers build directly with Postgres & diverse open storage formats on AWS S3. This is possible because LaminHub connects databases and storage locations in their host data centers where you run your compute loads.

Most functionality is available for AWS data centers, with support for other cloud providers and fully on-prem solutions also possible.

LaminHub is a SaaS product. For private data & commercial usage, see: [lamin.ai/pricing](https://lamin.ai/pricing).
