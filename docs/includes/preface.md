LaminDB is an open-source data framework to enable learning at scale in computational biology.
It lets you track data transformations, curate datasets, manage metadata, and query a built-in database for biological entities & data structures.

:::{dropdown} Why?

Reproducing analytical results or understanding how a dataset or model was created can be a pain.
Leave alone training models on historical data, orthogonal assays, or datasets generated by other teams.

Biological datasets are typically managed with versioned storage systems (file systems, object storage, git, dvc), {term}`UI`-focused community or SaaS platforms, structureless data lakes, rigid data warehouses (SQL, monolithic arrays), and data lakehouses for tabular data.

LaminDB goes further with a lakehouse that models biological datasets beyond tables with enough structure to enable queries and enough freedom to keep the pace of R&D high.

For data structures like `DataFrame`, `AnnData`, `.zarr`, `.tiledbsoma`, etc., LaminDB tracks the rich context that collaborative biological research requires and uses it to validate and index datasets to enable queries. In particular, you get

- data lineage: data sources and transformations; scientists and machine learning models
- domain knowledge and experimental metadata: the features and labels derived from domain entities

In this [blog post](https://blog.lamin.ai/problems), we discuss a breadth of data management problems of the field.

LaminHub is a data collaboration hub built on LaminDB similar to how GitHub is built on git.

## Quickstart

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Python
:sync: python

```{include} includes/quick-setup-lamindb.md

```

In a Python session, transfer an scRNA-seq dataset from the `laminlabs/cellxgene` instance, compute marker genes with Scanpy, and save results.

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: includes/py-quickstart.py
   :language: python
```

:::
:::{tab-item} R
:sync: r

```{include} includes/quick-setup-laminr.md

```

In an R session, transfer an scRNA-seq dataset from the `laminlabs/cellxgene` instance, compute marker genes with Seurat, and save results.

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: includes/r-quickstart.R
   :language: R
```

If you did _not_ use RStudio's notebook mode, create an html export and then run the following.

```R
laminr::lamin_save("my-analyis.Rmd")  # save source code and html report for a `.qmd` or `.Rmd` file
```
